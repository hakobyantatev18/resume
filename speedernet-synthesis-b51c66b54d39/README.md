The backend code is with Python, as well as the part of the interface, which is developed with a python open-source library Streamlit. 
In the sound and uploads folder are the audio files uploaded directly from my machine in order to do testing along the way. 
In order to run the code on the local machine you have to move into the interface folder with the command cd .\interface\
and run the ''streamlit run app.py'' command in the terminal. 
main.py is the code for the main page(this includes the transcription, speaker diarization and auto chapters) and the summary.py is the summary tool/page which you can access on the left side of the interface with a sidebar.
